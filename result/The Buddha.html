        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
Siddhartha Gautama, most commonly referred to as the Buddha (‘the awakened’), was a wandering ascetic and religious teacher who lived in South Asia during the 6th or 5th century BCE. He is the founder of Buddhism.
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
Here are some key points about the Buddha:
</p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
* Birth: According to Buddhist tradition, he was born in Lumbini, in what is now Nepal, to royal parents of the Shakya clan.
          </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
* Enlightenment: After leading a life of mendicancy, asceticism, and meditation, he attained enlightenment at Bodh Gaya in what is now India.
</p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
* Teachings: The Buddha taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and severe asceticism, leading to Nirvana, that is, freedom from ignorance, craving, rebirth, and suffering. His teachings are summarized in the Noble Eightfold Path, a training of the mind that includes ethical training and kindness toward others, and meditative practices such as sense restraint, mindfulness, and jhana/dhyana (meditation proper).
</p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">The title Buddha means ‘one who is awake’ — in the sense of having 'woken up to reality’. It is a title for those who are spiritually awake or enlightened, and have thus attained the supreme religious goal of Buddhism. The term Buddha is used by a number of religious groups in ancient India and had a range of meanings, but it came to be associated most strongly with the tradition of Buddhism.
