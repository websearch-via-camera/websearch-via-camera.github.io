        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          The Kaaba, also spelled Ka'bah, is a cube-shaped building at the center of Islam's most sacred mosque, Al-Masjid al-Haram, in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is the most sacred site in Islam and the direction (qibla) towards which Muslims around the world face during their prayers (Salat).

        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          Traditionally, it is believed that the Kaaba was originally built by Adam, the first prophet according to Islamic belief, and later rebuilt by Abraham (Ibrahim) and his son Ishmael (Ismail). The structure has been rebuilt and renovated several times throughout history. The Kaaba is draped in a black silk cloth known as the Kiswah, which is replaced annually during the Hajj pilgrimage.

        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          The Kaaba's dimensions are roughly 15 m (49 ft) high, 10.5 m (34 ft) on each side, covering a total area of 627 square feet. The building has a single door and no windows. Inside, there are three pillars that support the roof, with lamps hanging between them. 

        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          One of the most notable features of the Kaaba is the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad) embedded in the eastern cornerstone of the building. Pilgrims often try to touch or kiss the stone during the Hajj or Umrah pilgrimages, emulating the Prophet Muhammad's actions.

        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          The Kaaba serves as the focal point during the Hajj, the fifth pillar of Islam, which is a pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim is required to undertake at least once in their lifetime, provided they are physically and financially capable of making the journey. Millions of Muslims from around the world gather in Mecca annually to perform rituals around the Kaaba.

        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          Despite its significance, the Kaaba itself is not worshipped; instead, it symbolizes the unity of God in Islam. The act of facing the Kaaba during prayer (qibla) is meant to unify Muslims into a single community of believers, regardless of their geographical location.

        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
