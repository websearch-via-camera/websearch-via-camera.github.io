        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
The Ten Commandments are the set of religious and moral laws that God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          Different religions have different ways of numbering, wording, and interpreting the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments are based on two passages in the Bible: Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21. However, these passages do not explicitly divide the commandments into ten, so different traditions have developed different methods of grouping them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          For example, in Judaism, the first commandment is the statement "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery". This is considered a positive commandment to believe in God and acknowledge His role in history. The second commandment is the prohibition of idolatry, which includes making and worshipping any images of God or other gods.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          In Catholicism, the first commandment is the same as the second one in Judaism, but it is divided into two parts: "You shall have no other gods before me" and "You shall not make for yourself an idol". The first part forbids polytheism and the second part forbids idolatry. The tenth commandment is also divided into two parts: "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife" and "You shall not covet your neighbor's goods". The first part forbids lust and the second part forbids greed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          In Protestantism, the first commandment is "You shall have no other gods but me" and the second commandment is "You shall not make unto you any graven images". These are similar to the Catholic version, but they are more concise and emphasize the exclusivity of God. The tenth commandment is "You shall not covet anything that belongs to your neighbor", which combines the two parts of the Catholic version into one.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          In Islam, the Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, but they are derived from various verses and traditions. Some of the commandments are similar to the Jewish and Christian versions, such as the belief in one God, the prohibition of idolatry, the respect for parents, the sanctity of life, the prohibition of adultery, theft, and false witness, and the avoidance of envy. However, some of the commandments are different, such as the observance of the five daily prayers, the giving of alms, the fasting of Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca‚Åµ.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          These are some of the main differences among the religions regarding the Ten Commandments. However, there are also variations within each religion, depending on the denomination, interpretation, and context. The Ten Commandments are not only a set of rules, but also a source of inspiration, guidance, and dialogue for many people of faith. üôè</p>
