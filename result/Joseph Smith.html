                <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Joseph Smith (December 23, 1805 â€“ June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader and the founder of Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement. Born in Sharon, Vermont, Smith moved with his family to western New York during his youth. The region was experiencing religious revivalism during the Second Great Awakening, influencing Smith's perception. 

                </p>
        
                <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
                  In 1820, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, Smith reported having his First Vision, in which he said God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him and told him that all existing churches were corrupted and that he was chosen to restore the true Christian church. In 1823, he claimed an angel named Moroni appeared to him, revealing the location of a buried book made of golden plates containing the religious history of an ancient American civilization.

                </p>
        
                <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
                  In 1827, Smith said he was able to retrieve these plates and translated them into English by the power of God and published this translation in 1830 as the Book of Mormon. The same year, he founded the Church of Christ, the early organization that would grow into the Latter Day Saint movement. Smith's followers, known as Mormons, moved from New York to Ohio, then to Missouri, and finally to Illinois in search of a place where they could practice their religion without persecution.

                </p>
        
                <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Throughout his life, Smith continued to receive revelations, many of which he recorded in works such as the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, texts that, alongside the Bible and the Book of Mormon, are considered scripture by his followers. His innovations included unique doctrines about God and family structures, the practice of plural marriage (polygamy), and theocratic political ideals, which contributed to tensions with non-Mormon communities.

                </p>
        
                <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
                  In 1844, following a series of conflicts with non-Mormons and within the Mormon community itself, Smith declared his candidacy for the United States presidency. However, controversy and conflict continued to follow him, particularly related to the practice of polygamy and his destruction of a Nauvoo, Illinois, newspaper that criticized his power and practiced plural marriage. These actions led to increased tensions, and in June 1844, while imprisoned in Carthage, Illinois, on charges related to the newspaper incident, Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed by an armed mob.

                </p>
        
                <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Joseph Smith's teachings and revelations laid the foundation for several religious movements, with the largest being The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which has grown to be a global faith with millions of members.
