        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            Zaboor is the Arabic name for the book of Psalms, which is one of the holy books revealed by God to the prophet David, according to Islam. Muslims believe that the Zaboor mentioned in the Quran is the same as the Psalms of David in the Bible. The word Zaboor means "book", "inscription", or "writing" in Arabic.

        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            The Psalms are a collection of 150 songs and poems that express the prayers, praises, and emotions of the people of Israel to God. They are part of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. The Psalms cover various themes, such as God's love, justice, power, and glory, as well as human experiences, such as joy, sorrow, repentance, and faith. The Psalms are also known for their poetic and musical style, which reflects the talent and devotion of their authors and composers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            The Psalms are divided into five books, each with a different theme or purpose. The first book (Psalms 1-41) contains mostly psalms of David, who was the king of Israel and a man after God's own heart. The second book (Psalms 42-72) includes psalms of the sons of Korah, who were Levites and temple singers, and psalms of Asaph, who was a chief musician and a prophet. The third book (Psalms 73-89) features more psalms of Asaph and psalms of Ethan and Heman, who were wise men and singers. The fourth book (Psalms 90-106) contains psalms of Moses, who was the leader and lawgiver of Israel, and psalms of unknown authors that celebrate God's reign and covenant. The fifth book (Psalms 107-150) comprises psalms of thanksgiving, praise, and worship, as well as the psalms of ascents, which were sung by pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty mb-3  text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
            The Psalms are a rich source of inspiration and guidance for believers of all times and places. They teach us how to pray, how to praise, how to trust, and how to live in God's presence. They also reveal God's character, his works, his promises, and his plan for his people. The Psalms are quoted or alluded to more than any other book of the Old Testament in the New Testament, especially by Jesus and the apostles. The Psalms are also used in the worship and liturgy of the Jewish and Christian traditions.
